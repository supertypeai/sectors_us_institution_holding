# About the project

**`edgartools`** is one of the nicest looking EDGAR libraries out there. It is also powerful and easy to use.
You can query, filter and select any filing since 1994 and view the filing's html, text, xml or structured data.


## Getting started

Install using pip
```bash
pip install edgartools
```

Import and start using
```python
from edgar import *

# Tell the SEC who you are
set_identity("Michael Mccallum mike.mccalum@indigo.com")

filings = get_filings()
```

# Concepts

## How do I find a filing?
Depends on what you know

### A. I know the accession number

```python
filing = find("0001065280-23-000273")
```

### B. I know the company ticker or cik

```python
filings = Company("NFLX").get_filings(form="10-Q").latest(1)
```

### C. Show me a list of filings

```python
filings = get_filings(form="10-Q")
filing = filings[0]
```

## What can I do with a filing

You can **view** it in the terminal or **open** it in the browser, get the filing as **html**, **xml** or **text**, 
and download **attachments**. You can extract data from the filing into a data object.

## What can I do with a company

You can get the company's **filings**, **facts** and **financials**.

# Installation

```console
pip install edgartools
```

# Usage


## Set your Edgar user identity

Before you can access the SEC Edgar API you need to set the identity that you will use to access Edgar.
This is usually your name and email, or a company name and email.
```bash
Sample Company Name AdminContact@<sample company domain>.com
```

The user identity is sent in the User-Agent string and the Edgar API will refuse to respond to your request without it.

EdgarTools will look for an environment variable called `EDGAR_IDENTITY` and use that in each request.
So, you need to set this environment variable before using it.

### Setting EDGAR_IDENTITY in Linux/Mac
```bash
export EDGAR_IDENTITY="Michael Mccallum mcalum@gmail.com"
```

### Setting EDGAR_IDENTITY in Windows Powershell
```bash
 $Env:EDGAR_IDENTITY="Michael Mccallum mcalum@gmail.com"
```
Alternatively, you can call `set_identity` which does the same thing.

```python
from edgar import set_identity
set_identity("Michael Mccallum mcalum@gmail.com")
```
For more detail see https://www.sec.gov/os/accessing-edgar-data

## Usage

### Importing edgar

```python
from edgar import *
```

### Getting filings
```python

# Get filings for the current year and quarter
filings = get_filings() 

# Get filings for 2022
filings = get_filings(2022)                 # OR filings = get_filings(year=2022)

# Get filings for 2022 quarter 4
filings = get_filings(2022, 4)              # OR filings = get_filings(year=2022, quarter=4)

# Get filings for 2020, 2021 and 2022
filings = get_filings([2020, 2021, 2022])   # OR filings = get_filings(year=range(2020, 2023))

# Get filings for 2020 quarters 1 and 2
filings = get_filings(2020, quarter=[1,2])
```
![Get filings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/get_filings.jpg)



### Filtering filings

```python
# Filter for form D
filings.filter(form="D")

# Filter for form 10-K and 10-Q 
filings.filter(form=["10-K", "10-Q"])

# When you filter by form e.g. "D" it includes amendments e.g. "D\A". You can omit amendments
filings.filter(form="D", amendments=False)

# Filter by filing_date. date and filing_date mean the same thing
# Get all filings on 2023-02-23
filings.filter(date="2023-02-23")                      
# OR
filings.filter(filing_date="2023-02-23")

# Filter to get all filings between 2023-01-23 and 2023-02-23     
filings.filter(date="2023-01-23:2023-02-23")

# Filter to get all filings since 2023-01-23   
filings.filter(date="2023-01-23")

# Filter to get all filings before 2023-02-23     
filings.filter(date=":2023-02-23")
```

### Combining getting and filtering
```python
get_filings(2022, form="D")
```

### Convert the filings to a pandas dataframe

The filings data is stored in the `Filings` class as a `pyarrow.Table`. You can get the data as a pandas dataframe using
`to_pandas`
```python
df = filings.to_pandas()
```


## Navigating filings

The Filings object allows you to navigate through filings using `filings.next()` and `filings.prev()`. 
This shows you pages of the data - the page size is about 50. 

```python
# To see the next page of data
filings.next()

# To see the previous page
filings.prev()

# To see the current page
filings.current()
```

![Get next filings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/filings_next.jpg)

## Getting the latest filings

You can get the latest **n** filings by filing_date from a filings using `filings.latest()`.

If you provide the parameter `n` it will return the latest `n` filings.

```python
filing = filings.latest(n=5)
filing
```
![Latest filings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/latest_filings.jpg)


If you omit this parameter, or set `n=1` it will return a single `Filings object.

```python
filing = filings.latest()
filing
```
![Latest filing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/latest_filing.jpg)


## Filtering filings

You can filter the filings object using te `filter()` function. This allows you to filter
by filing date, or by form.

### Filtering filings by date

To filter by filing date specify the filing date in **YYYY-MM-DD** format e.g. **2022-01-24**
(Note the parameters `date` and `filing_date` are equivalent aliases for each other)
```python
filings.filter(date="2021-01-24") # or filings.filter(filing_date="2021-01-24")
```
You can specify a filing date range using the colon

```python
filings.filter(date="2021-01-12:2021-02-28") 
```
To filter by dates before a specified date use `:YYYY-MM-DD'

```python
filings.filter(date=":2021-02-28") 
```

To filter by dates after a specified date use `YYYY-MM-DD:'

```python
filings.filter(date="2021-02-28:") 
```

### Filtering filings by form

You can filter filings by form using the `form` parameter. 

```python
filings.filter(form="10-K") 
```

To filter by form e.g. **10-K** and include form amendments use `amendments = True`. 

```python
filings.filter(form="10-K", amendments=True) 
```
![Filter with amendments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/filter_amendments.jpg)

## Working with a single filing

You can get a single filing from the filings using the bracket operator `[]`, 
specifying the index of the filing. The index is the value displayed in the leftmost
position in the filings table. For example, to get the **10-Q** for **Costco** in the table above
use `filings[3]`

```python
filing = filings[3]
```

![Costco 10Q filing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/costco_10Q.jpg)

### View the filing homepage
You can view the filing homepage in the terminal using `filing.homepage`

This gives you access to the `FilingHomepage` class that you can use to list all the documents
and datafiles on the filing.

```python
filing.homepage
```
![Filing homepage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/filing_homepage.jpg)

### Open a filing

You can open the filing in your browser using `filing.open()`. This will work on environments with access to the browser, 
will probably not work on a remote server.
```python
filing.open()
```

### Open the Filing Homepage
You can open the filing homepage in the browser using `filing.homepage.open()`.
```python
filing.homepage.open()
```

### View the filing as Markdown
You can view the filing's HTML content as markdown in the console using `view()`. It works for all filing types
but can be a little slow for filings with large HTML files
```python
filing.view()
```

### Get the filing's html
You can get the html content of the filing using`.html()`
```python
filing.html()
```

### Get the filing's html as Markdown
You can get the html content as markdown using`.markdown()`
```python
filing.markdown()
```

## Viewing and downloading attachments

Every filing has a list of attachments. You can view the attachments using `filing.attachments`

```python
# View the attachments
filing.attachments
```
![Filing attachments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/filing_attachments.png)

You can access each attachment using the bracket operator `[]` and the index of the attachment.
    
```python
# Get the first attachment
attachment = filing.attachments[0]
```

![Filing attachments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgunning/edgartools/main/docs/images/filing_attachment.png)

You can download the attachment using `attachment.download()`. This will download the attachment to string or bytes in memory. 

## Automatic parsing of filing data

Now the reason you may want to download attachments is to get information contained in data files.
For example, **13F-HR** filings have attached infotable.xml files containing data from the holding report for that filing.

Fortunately, the library handles this for you. If you call `filing.obj()` it will automatically download and parse the data files
into a data object, for several different form types. Currently, the following forms are supported:

| Form                       | Data Object            | Description                           |
|----------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 10-K                       | `TenK`                 | Annual report                         |
| 10-Q                       | `TenQ`                 | Quarterly report                      |
| 8-K                        | `EightK`               | Current report                        |
| MA-I                       | `MunicipalAdvisorForm` | Municipal advisor initial filing      |
| Form 144                   | `Form144`              | Notice of proposed sale of securities |
| C, C-U, C-AR, C-TR         | `FormC`                | Form C Crowdfunding Offering          |
| D                          | `FormD`                | Form D Offering                       |
| 3,4,5                      | `Ownership`            | Ownership reports                     |
| 13F-HR                     | `ThirteenF`            | 13F Holdings Report                   |
| NPORT-P                    | `FundReport`           | Fund Report                           |
| EFFECT                     | `Effect`               | Notice of Effectiveness               |
| And other filing with XBRL | `FilingXbrl`           |                                       |

For example, to get the data object for a **13F-HR** filing you can do the following:

```python
filings = get_filings(form="13F-HR")
filing = filings[0]
thirteenf = filing.obj()
```

![Filing attachments](docs/images/thirteenF.png)

If you call `obj()` on a filing that does not have a data file, then it will return `None`.


## Working with XBRL filings

Some filings are in **XBRL (eXtensible Business Markup Language)** format. 
These are mainly the newer filings, as the SEC has started requiring this for newer filings.

If a filing is in XBRL format then it opens up a lot more ways to get structured data about that specific filing and also 
about the company referred to in that filing.

The `Filing` class has an `xbrl` function that will download, parse and structure the filing's XBRL document if one exists.
If it does not exist, then `filing.xbrl()` will return `None`.

The function `filing.xbrl()` returns a `FilingXbrl` instance, which wraps the data, and provides convenient
ways of working with the xbrl data.


```python
filing_xbrl = filing.xbrl()
```

## Using the Company API

With the company API you find a company using the **cik** or **ticker**. 
From the company you can access all their historical **filings**,
and a dataset of the company **facts**.
The SEC's company API also supplies a lot more details about a company including industry, the SEC filer type,
the mailing and business address and much more.

### Find a company using the cik
The **cik** is the id that uniquely identifies a company at the SEC.
It is a number, but is sometimes shown in SEC Edgar resources as a string padded with leading zero's.
For the edgar client API, just use the numbers and omit the leading zeroes.

```python
company = Company(1324424)
```

### Find a company using ticker

You can get a company using a ticker e.g. **SNOW**. This will do a lookup for the company cik using the ticker, then load the company using the cik.
This makes it two calls versus one for the cik company lookup, but is sometimes more convenient since tickers are easier to remember that ciks.

Note that some companies have multiple tickers, so you technically cannot get SEC filings for a ticker.
You instead get the SEC filings for the company to which the ticker belongs.

The ticker is case-insensitive so you can use `Company("snow")`
or `Company("SNOW")`
```python
snow = Company("snow")
```

### 


```python
Company(1832950)
```

### Get filings for a company
To get the company's filings use `get_filings()`. This gets all the company's filings that are available from the Edgar submissions endpoint.

```python
company.get_filings()
```
### Filtering filings
You can filter the company filings using a number of different parameters.

```python
class CompanyFilings:
    
    ...
    
    def get_filings(self,
                    *,
                    form: str | List = None,
                    accession_number: str | List = None,
                    file_number: str | List = None,
                    is_xbrl: bool = None,
                    is_inline_xbrl: bool = None
                    ):
        """
        Get the company's filings and optionally filter by multiple criteria
        :param form: The form as a string e.g. '10-K' or List of strings ['10-Q', '10-K']
        :param accession_number: The accession number that uniquely identifies an SEC filing e.g. 0001640147-22-000100
        :param file_number: The file number e.g. 001-39504
        :param is_xbrl: Whether the filing is xbrl
        :param is_inline_xbrl: Whether the filing is inline_xbrl
        :return: The CompanyFiling instance with the filings that match the filters
        """
```


#### The CompanyFilings class
The result of `get_filings()` is a `CompanyFilings` class. This class contains a pyarrow table with the filings
and provides convenient functions for working with filings.
You can access the underlying pyarrow `Table` using the `.data` property

```python
filings = company.get_filings()

# Get the underlying Table
data: pa.Table = filings.data
```

#### Get a filing by index
To access a filing in the CompanyFilings use the bracket `[]` notation e.g. `filings[2]`
```python
filings[2]
```

#### Get the latest filing

The `CompanyFilings` class has a `latest` function that will return the latest `Filing`. 
So, to get the latest **10-Q** filing, you do the following
```python
# Latest filing makes sense if you filter by form  type e.g. 10-Q
snow_10Qs = snow.get_filings(form='10-Q')
latest_10Q = snow_10Qs.latest()

# Or chain the function calls
snow.get_filings(form='10-Q').latest()
```


### Get company facts

Facts are an interesting and important dataset about a company accumlated from data the company provides to the SEC.
Company facts are available for a company on the Company Facts`f"https://data.sec.gov/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK{cik:010}.json"`
It is a JSON endpoint and `edgartools` parses the JSON into a structured dataset - a `pyarrow.Table`.

#### Getting facts for a company
To get company facts, first get the company, then call `company.get_facts()`

```python
company = Company("SNOW")
company_facts = company.get_facts()
```
The result is a `CompanyFacts` object which wraps the underlying facts and provides convenient ways of working
with the facts data. To get access to the underyling data use the `facts` property.

You can get the facts as a pandas dataframe by calling `to_pandas`

```python
df = company_facts.to_pandas()
```

Facts differ among companies. To see what facts are available you can use the `facts_meta` property.
